This is a Performance Optimization guide for the ["ASUS Z9PE-D8_WS":http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/Z9PED8_WS/] motherboard. The guide initially offers optimizations geared towards HPC but can be extended for other purposes e.g. gaming performance. The optimization includes performance-related BIOS parameters as well as OS settings. The motivation of this Guide is to also prepare an ["Experimental Design":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_experiments] to find the best of the different parameter combinations. 

Why this guide? The Z9PED8 WS is arguably the most powerful Worstation motherboard out there and a very appealing solution for HPC and as well above average gaming rig. 

The main reference for this guid is the official ["ASUS Users Manual":http://dlcdnet.asus.com/pub/ASUS/mb/LGA2011/Z9PE-D8-WS/Manual/E7358_Z9PE-D8_WS.pdf].

h2. BIOS Performance Settings

* AI Tweaker Menu 
** AI Overclock Tuner [Auto]: TODO
** Clock Spread Spectrum [Disabled]: disabled by default, enhances AI overclocking. 
* DRAM Timing Control
** DRAM latencies WRITE, READ etc.: TODO interesting to try different values maybe to match those of the RAM specs.
* CPU Configuration
** Execute Disabled Bit [Enabled â€“> Disabled]: prevents malicious buffer overflow attacks when combined with a supporting OS (only enterprise OS versions support this) e.g. Ubuntu does not support it so we can safely disable it. Researching this feature reveals that it may degrade performance and may even cause application/system crashes in non supported OS. 


The following selected BIOS settings (or factors) affect performance in various ways and their values (or factor levels) are discussed.
