h1. ["ASUS Z9PE-D8_WS":http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/Z9PED8_WS/] motherboard Optimization Guide

This is a Performance Optimization guide for the ["ASUS Z9PE-D8_WS":http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/Z9PED8_WS/] motherboard. The guide initially offers optimizations geared towards HPC but can be extended for other purposes e.g. gaming performance. The optimization includes performance-related BIOS parameters as well as OS settings. The motivation of this Guide is to also prepare an ["Experimental Design":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_experiments] to find the best of the different parameter combinations. 

Why this guide? The Z9PED8 WS is arguably the most powerful Worstation motherboard out there and a very appealing solution for HPC and as well above average gaming rig. 

The main reference for this guid is the official ["ASUS Users Manual":http://dlcdnet.asus.com/pub/ASUS/mb/LGA2011/Z9PE-D8-WS/Manual/E7358_Z9PE-D8_WS.pdf].

h2. BIOS Performance Settings

* <code>AI Tweaker Menu</code> 
** <code>AI Overclock Tuner [Auto]</code>: TODO
** <code>Clock Spread Spectrum [Disabled]</code>: disabled by default, enhances AI overclocking. 
* <code>DRAM Timing Control</code>
** <code>DRAM latencies WRITE, READ</code> etc.: TODO interesting to try different values maybe to match those of the RAM specifications.
* <code>CPU Configuration</code>
** <code>Execute Disabled Bit [Enabled –> Disabled]</code>: The Execute Disabled Bit (EDB) prevents malicious buffer overflow attacks when combined with a supporting OS (only enterprise OS versions support this) e.g. Ubuntu does not support it so we can safely disable it. Researching this feature reveals that it may degrade performance and may even cause application/system crashes in non supported OS. 
** <code>Server Class [Custom –> HPC]</code>: options include <code>[Custom, Enterprise or HPC]</code> low level cache prefetching behavior TODO. 
* <code>CPU Configuration</code>
** <code>Intel Virtualization Technology [Enabled –> Disabled]</code>: working in native, there is no need to enable I-VT, researching this parameter turns out that it inhibits automatic overclocking and may ceil performance in native mode.
** <code>Local APIC Mode [Auto]</code>: APIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controllers) relevant for multi-processor configurations see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_APIC and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_APIC#Problems
* <code>CPU Power Management</code>
** <code>Power Technology [Custom]</code>: Controls power management features TODO.
** <code>Power Technology [Custom] –> Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology [Enabled –> Disabled]</code>: may slow things down as CPUs are continuously tuned for power consumption/performance trade-off, may not relevant for HPC machines. 
** <code>Energy Performance [Balanced Performance –> Performance]</code>: optimize power management towards performance. 
* <code>Chipset QPI Configuration</code>
** <code>Isoc [Enabled]</code>: TODO Vudu parameter but sounds important :)
** <code>QPI Link Speed Mode [Fast]</code>: QPI (Intel QuickPath interconnect) protocol that allows fast direct connection between two CPUs.

The following selected BIOS settings (or factors) affect performance in various ways and their values (or factor levels) are discussed.

h3. Ubuntu 12.04

** <code>CPU Configuration –> Local APIC Mode [Auto]</code> may slow things down and risk stability issues and often advised to disable while troubleshooting Ubuntu issues <code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash reboot=bios acpi=off noapic nolapic"</code>

h3. Windows 7
